### Sunlight

#### Features

- ☀️ Discover how much sunlight you have per day and graph it
- 💡 Get rewarded with <kbd>☀️ Sun Minutes</kbd> and set a goal to reach

#### 🔍 How does it work?

Sunlight continuously samples the device's light sensor, records it, and then, after a minute of
sunlight, calculates the sunlight minutes accumulated and logs it to your day.

#### 🕒 How is the battery?

The app saves battery by automatically stopping the sampling at night, since there's no sun at night
in most places.
